# **📦 Data Marketplace Smart Contract**

A decentralized marketplace for encrypted datasets, powered by **USDC payments on Base**, **Storacha for encrypted storage**, and **UCAN** for post-purchase access control.

This repository contains:

* The Solidity smart contract (`DataMarketplace.sol`)
* Comprehensive Foundry tests (`DataMarketplace.t.sol`)
* Deployment script for Base (`Deploy.s.sol`)
* Documentation for the full seller → buyer → backend → Storacha flow

# **🧩 What This Marketplace Actually Does**

This is **NOT** a file-hosting system.

This is a **trustless payment + purchase-record system** where:

* Encrypted data lives on **Storacha/IPFS**
* Decryption keys stay **off-chain**
* Buyers pay in **USDC**
* Smart contract records the purchase (canonical truth)
* Backend reads events → enables access through **UCAN**
* Sellers withdraw proceeds after a **24-hour security delay**

The contract **never handles plaintext keys** → compliant with EU Data Act privacy constraints.

# **✨ Contract Features (MVP)**

| Feature                 | Description                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Encrypted data listings | Sellers upload encrypted files to Storacha + publish metadata on-chain                    |
| Envelope metadata       | `envelopeCid` (Storacha CID) + `envelopeHash` (keccak256 hash of canonical envelope JSON) |
| USDC payments           | Buyer pays in stablecoins on Base                                                         |
| Platform fee            | Default 2.5%, configurable by owner                                                       |
| Purchase record         | Public on-chain purchase proof for UCAN access                                            |
| Withdrawal delay        | 24h security period (per-listing)                                                         |
| Safe transfers          | All token operations via `SafeERC20`                                                      |
| Reentrancy protections  | All sensitive operations are `nonReentrant`                                               |
| Multi-withdraw          | Sellers can withdraw multiple listings in a single transaction                            |

This ensures a **secure, tamper-evident**, decentralized payment layer for data commerce.

# **🔐 Encryption Model (EnvelopeCID + EnvelopeHash)**

Each listing includes:

### **1. `dataCid`**

Pointer to **encrypted dataset** stored on Storacha.

### **2. `envelopeCid`**

Pointer to **non-secret envelope.json**, containing:

* encryption scheme
* file chunks
* key lookup info
* maybe re-encryption or metadata

### **3. `envelopeHash`**

```
bytes32 envelopeHash = keccak256(canonicalEnvelopeJson)
```

This ensures:

* Backend verifies envelope hasn't been modified
* Buyers can trust envelope metadata
* No reliance on a centralized database for critical integrity

# **⚙️ Installation**

```
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std
```

Add to `remappings.txt`:

```
openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/
forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/
```

# **📦 Environment Variables**

```
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="..."
PRIVATE_KEY="..."
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="..."
```

---

# **💵 USDC Address (Base Sepolia)**

```
0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e

# **🚀 Deployment**

Run a deployment script (example):

```bash
source .env
```

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \
  --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast \
  --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY \
  --chain-id 84532 \
  -vvvv
```

# **🧪 Running Tests**

```
forge test -vvv
```

Coverage:

```
forge coverage
```

Our current suite reaches:

* **96%+ line coverage**
* **90%+ branch coverage**
* **Full reentrancy simulation using malicious token mock**

# **📈 End-to-End Data Access Flow (Cryptographically Safe)**

### **Seller Flow**

1. Seller uploads encrypted file to Storacha → gets `dataCid`
2. Seller generates envelope JSON (metadata)
3. Seller uploads envelope.json → gets `envelopeCid`
4. Seller computes:

   ```
   envelopeHash = keccak256(canonicalEnvelopeJson)
   ```
5. Seller calls:

   ```
   createListing(dataCid, envelopeCid, envelopeHash, price)
   ```
6. Listing is now live.

---

# **🔄 Buyer Purchase Flow**

1. Buyer approves USDC

2. Buyer calls:

   ```
   purchaseAccess(listingId)
   ```

3. Contract:

   * Transfers USDC
   * Records purchase permanently
   * Emits `PurchaseCompleted`

4. Backend picks up the event → begins access provisioning.

---

# **🔑 UCAN Key Delivery Flow (Off-chain, secure)**

After verifying an on-chain purchase:

### Backend steps:

1. Watch `PurchaseCompleted(listingId, buyer, …)`
2. Fetch envelope JSON from `envelopeCid`
3. Validate:

   ```
   keccak256(envelopeJson) == envelopeHash
   ```
4. Require buyer to provide **RSA public key**
5. Notify seller: “Buyer X purchased dataset”
6. Seller encrypts AES key:

   ```
   ciphertext_K_for_buyer = Encrypt(buyerPubKey, AES_key)
   ```
7. Seller uploads ciphertext to Storacha → receives `keyCid`
8. Seller submits `keyCid` to backend
9. Backend authorizes buyer via UCAN token:

   * scope to `dataCid`
   * includes `keyCid` for decrypting

### Buyer retrieves file:

1. Buyer fetches ciphertext AES key (`keyCid`)
2. Decrypts with private key
3. Downloads encrypted dataset (`dataCid`)
4. Decrypts final dataset

Smart contract is **never exposed** to plaintext keys → zero custodial liability.
